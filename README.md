ChessBoard
==========

A flexible implementation of a chess board with algebraic notation
processing and an understanding of the rules of the game. Uses
angular.js for UI components.

=========

See demo/index.html for an example of how to use this package. The
only tricky part of getting this to work is invoking the loadTemplate
function properly. That function should be invoked with the path where
the templates for the angular directives are hosted. You will need to
host the root directory of the repository using an http server for
demo.html to work correctly.
